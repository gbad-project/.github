## Welcome

Welcome to the official GitHub page of the Graph-Based Archival Description project. The project is brought to you by a team from the Archives of Ontario and University of Toronto and co-funded from a Canadian federal grant.

# Implementation Toolkit

April 2025 Update: To allow archivists, librarians and others to replicate this work within their own institutions, Bachelor of Information students Thomas Fox, Harrison Huang and Russell Luchin created a toolkit for the Graph-Based Archival Description used at the Archives of Ontario.

Note: As of June 2, 2025, the Toolkit [was found](https://github.com/gbad-project/records_in_contexts_draw_io_parser/tree/99cdb78637abbe14e2a0cad3f63b0ca7d1df0c30/reproduce_gbad_toolkit) to require additional Python programming to be reproduced. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/gbad-project/records_in_contexts_draw_io_parser/issues/new) if you are reading this and need help, or reach out using the contacts indicated on the

## Project Summary

The Archives of Ontario, the GLAM Incubator and Profs. Anastasia Kuzminykh and Shion Guha at the University of Toronto have collaborated to create a proof of concept that explores the possibilities and potential benefits of a graph-based data model for archival description, using the International Council on Archives’ new Records in Contexts (RiC) standard and Linked Open Data (RDF data format) ([Introductory YouTube video](https://youtu.be/TLHU_0QKOWQ)). The traditional archival finding aid, with its static and inflexible hierarchies, fails to represent the complexity and nuanced reality of record creation, accumulation, use and re-use over time.

Recent efforts to overcome this limitation have turned to entity-relationship based models developed by the graph theory of knowledge representation, with its infinitely flexible and extensible subject-predicate-object expressions of data (semantic triples). The overall objective of this project is to develop a data model, to select and model a small-scale sample of data drawn from the Archives of Ontario’s datasets, and to thereby test the possibilities and potential benefits for internal staff and public end-users. This work represents a paradigm shift for archival description: it promises a vastly improved ability to represent the reality of record creation, to manage the complexity of digital metadata, to allow machine-readable encoding of meaning that enables complex logical inferences and search capabilities, and to connect currently siloed datasets with related data across the world. In short, this proposed project will break new ground in the Canadian archival sector.
